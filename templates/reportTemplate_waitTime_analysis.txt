# Report for the wait time procedure analysis

Command line:

${cmmd_line}

This analysis is focused on the ${polna} case performed between ${date_range}.

The dictionary with the information and results are saved in ${fileout}.

The wait time and voltage configurations are:

WT: ${metdat['WT_in']} 

VD: ${metdat['VD_in']} 

The count map for the WT dataset is:

% for cc in metdat['WT']['count']:
	${cc}
% endfor


# Results

Plot of the count map:

![](${figname['count']})

Plots of the input/output configurations of wait time:

![](${figname['waittime']})

Plots of the input/output configurations of voltage:

![](${figname['voltage']})

Plot of the wait time measured for each set:

![](${figname['settingtime']})
